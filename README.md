# 🛡️ Detection Engineering Portfolio

Welcome. I’m a blue team engineer focused on real-world threat detection, automation, and incident response. This GitHub showcases my work in:

- ✅ Detection-as-Code (Sigma Rules, MITRE ATT&CK mappings)
- 🛠️ Custom blue team tools (EDR automation, log normalization)
- ☁️ Cloud and SaaS threat detection (Okta, AWS, M365)
- 📘 Incident response playbooks and analysis

This is an evolving library of real-world defensive work, built for practical use.

🧠 _Detection is an engineering problem. I build to solve it._
